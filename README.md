## Completed Tasks
### **Assignment 01**

1. Generated two vectors with 15 random floats each and plotted them on the same graph with labeled axes and a title.
2. Created a 4x4 matrix with random values and visualized it as a heatmap with labeled rows and columns.
3. Generated two 4x4 matrices, performed addition, subtraction, and multiplication, visualized the results using bar plots, and analyzed the effects.

### **Assignment 02**

1. Create a 3x3 Matrix of Random Integers between 1 and 50
2. Create a 3x3 Matrix of Random Integers between 1 and 50 With a fixed seed
3. Create a 3x3 Matrix of Random Integers between 1 and 50 Without a fixed seed



## Software and Tools Used

## Discussion and Observations
### **Assignment 01**
- The plotted vectors showed varying trends and distributions.
- The heatmap representation effectively highlighted value distributions within the matrix.
- The arithmetic operations on matrices provided insights into numerical relationships, and bar plots aided in comparative analysis.

### **Assignment 02**

- **Task 1:** Generates a random 3x3 matrix without setting a seed. As a result, the output will differ every time the script is run. This is called a non-deterministic process, meaning the results are unpredictable and unique on each execution.

- **Task 2:** Uses a fixed random seed (10 in this case). By setting the seed, the random number generation becomes deterministic. This means that the same sequence of random numbers (and hence the same matrix) will be produced every time the script runs, ensuring reproducibility.

- **Task 3:** Similar to Task 1, it generates another random matrix without a seed, leading to different values with every execution. However, itâ€™s a fresh random matrix generated independently from Task 1.
