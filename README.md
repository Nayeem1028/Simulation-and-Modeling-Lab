## Covered Concepts

- Matrix Functions
- Matrix Arithmetic Operations
- Matrix Visualization (Line Graph, Bar Plot, Heatmap)

## Completed Tasks
- **Assignment 01**

1. Generated two vectors with 15 random floats each and plotted them on the same graph with labeled axes and a title.
2. Created a 4x4 matrix with random values and visualized it as a heatmap with labeled rows and columns.
3. Generated two 4x4 matrices, performed addition, subtraction, and multiplication, visualized the results using bar plots, and analyzed the effects.

- **Assignment 02**

1.Create a 3x3 Matrix of Random Integers between 1 and 50
2.Create a 3x3 Matrix of Random Integers between 1 and 50 With a fixed seed
3.Create a 3x3 Matrix of Random Integers between 1 and 50 Without a fixed seed
