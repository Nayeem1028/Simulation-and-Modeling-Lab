## Student Information

- **Name:** Nayeem Islam
- **ID:** 2215151028
- **Section:** 7A2
- **University:** University of Information Technology and Sciences 
- **Course Code:** CSE 413
- **Course Name:** Simulation and Modeling Lab
- **Course Teacher:** Audity Ghosh

## Covered Concepts

- Matrix Functions
- Matrix Arithmetic Operations
- Matrix Visualization (Line Graph, Bar Plot, Heatmap)

## Completed Tasks

1. Generated two vectors with 15 random floats each and plotted them on the same graph with labeled axes and a title.
2. Created a 4x4 matrix with random values and visualized it as a heatmap with labeled rows and columns.
3. Generated two 4x4 matrices, performed addition, subtraction, and multiplication, visualized the results using bar plots, and analyzed the effects.

## Software and Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab

## Discussion and Observations

- The plotted vectors showed varying trends and distributions.
- The heatmap representation effectively highlighted value distributions within the matrix.
- The arithmetic operations on matrices provided insights into numerical relationships, and bar plots aided in comparative analysis.
